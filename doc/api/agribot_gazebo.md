### About the *agribot_gazebo* package

this package contains the models of plants and the world which is designed to robot be spawned into it and it looks like a small farm. it has a launch file to spawn the robot and initialize the world.

**`NOTE`** make sure you have updated your gazebo and you have installed gazebo-ros and controller-manager packages before running the simulation. used these commands to install them properly.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-<DISTRO_OF_YOUR_ROS>-gazebo-ros*
sudo apt-get install ros-<DISTRO_OF_YOUR_ROS>-controller-manager
```
the created simulation provides IMU, GPS, Camera and wheel Odometry on the same topics as actual robot which gives this opportunity to run same codes on the simulation as the actual robot without any changes.
The image below shows the final version of simulation area and a robot spawned into environment.

## Adding Plant modes to Gazebo

add plant models to gazebo models using command below, first navigate to agribot/agribot_gazebo: 

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/agribot/agribot_gazebo/models
```

then copy models to gazebo models folder by:

in z-shell
```
sudo mv plant_/* ~/.gazebo/models/
```
or in  shell
```
sudo mv plant_* ~/.gazebo/models/
```
now you should be able to see plant models in gazebo models lists according to image below

To launch the `agribot_gazebo` simply run: 
```
$ roslaunch agribot_gazebo agribot_sb_farm.launch
```

**`NOTE`** to find more information about gazebo environment and how to define robots in this simulator please visit [Gazebo website](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_urdf) 

the launch file is taking the configuration of an empty world which is a default layer in gazebo environment and then makes the farm model on top of it. also, with given coordinates spawns the robot too. 

**`NOTE`** the description of the robot is loading from `agribot_control` package which contains the controllers and main description of the robot in format of URDF and XACRO files. for more information visit [agribot_control](https://github.com/PRBonn/agribot/blob/master/doc/api/agribot_control.md)
